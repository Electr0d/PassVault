# PassVault
A simple program that stores your passwords, locally, and encrypted.


## Features
### Add Menu
Add email/username and password. Duh.

Open the add menu by clicking on the "+" sign, or press **Alt + A**

What is the service that provides your with the username/email? Reddit? Facebook?

- Email

Your email or username.

- Password

The secret.


### Table
This is the heart of your vault. Where your passwords lie. You can:
- Copy cells

Want to quickly copy something? Just click on a cell, and its in your clipboard.


- Edit rows

changed a password? You can change it here too!


- Delete rows

Want to delete a row? Click on the trashcan icon, and it's gone... forever (if you save your changes).


- Strength meter

PassVault tells you how strong a password is. Having upper and lower case characteres, numbers, as well as special characters make it stronger.

- Save

Everytime you add something, a save button will appear to asking you to confirm your changes. Click on that button to confirm your changes, or press **Ctrl + S**


### Search

Have a ton of rows and want to get to one quickly? The search bar is for you. Just click on the magnifier icon, or press **Ctrl + F" to open the search bar.
Every cell checked if it includes your keyword. You can check what columns is searched by in the filter menu, which you can open by clicking on the filter icon, or by pressing **Alt + F**
For example, if you have only "service" checked and type "Google", then the program lists every row that contains "Google" in the service column.

### Settings Menu
This is where you tweak your vault. You can open the settings menu by clicking on the gear icon, or pressing **Alt + S**

This shows border around every row. It is off by default.

Set to dark theme by default to protect you from the blinding light mode.

This is where you change the master password you use to enter the vault.

Go back to the login menu.


- About

About me!

## Security
PassVault uses AES 256 bits encryption algorithm. Means your data is secure, somewhat. The problem is that the key is also stored locally. It is the same as if you have the key to your house under a doormat.

I personally recommend you change around the security settings if you want to be more secure, but you should be find either way.
